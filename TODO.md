# TODO: Slack RAG Chatbot Implementation

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Structure ✅
- [x] Create project directory structure `slack-rag-bot/`
- [x] Set up `pyproject.toml` with all necessary dependencies (using uv)
- [x] Create `.env` with all required environment variables
- [x] Set up `config.py` for environment variable management

## Phase 2: Vertex AI RAG Engine Integration ✅
- [x] Implement `vertex_rag_client.py` with RAG Engine functionality
- [x] Add search query preprocessing and optimization
- [x] Implement result formatting with full chunks (not just snippets)
- [x] **Fix confidence scoring (now uses actual relevance scores)**
- [x] Add grounded generation toggle configuration
- [x] Migrate from Discovery Engine to RAG Engine for proper chunk-based search

## Phase 3: Slack Bot Core Features ✅
- [x] Implement basic Slack Bolt app initialization in `app.py`
- [x] Add socket mode configuration for easy deployment
- [x] Handle @mentions to the bot (`@whatsupdoc <query>`)
- [x] Handle slash commands (`/ask <query>`)
- [x] Handle direct messages (DMs) to the bot
- [x] Implement basic query-response flow

## Phase 4: Advanced Bot Features ✅
- [x] Add rich response formatting with Slack blocks and markdown
- [x] Implement loading messages for better UX during searches
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] **Implement conversation context tracking for follow-up questions**
- [x] Add rate limiting (max 10 queries per user per minute)
- [x] Add query preprocessing (cleaning and optimization)

## Phase 5: Response Formatting & UX ✅
- [x] Format responses to show top 5 most relevant snippets
- [x] Include source document names in responses
- [x] Add confidence indicators to responses (though scoring needs fix)
- [ ] Implement "View more results" option when available
- [x] Add proper emoji and formatting for better readability

## Phase 6: LLM Integration ✅
- [x] **Add Vertex AI Gemini integration for answer generation**
- [x] **Implement grounded generation using retrieved chunks**
- [x] **Add citation support linking answers to source documents**
- [x] **Create prompt templates for research paper Q&A**
- [x] **Add fallback to search-only mode when LLM fails**
- [x] **Upgrade to Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite for better performance and cost**
- [x] **Fix context length limiting (increased from 8k to 100k characters)**

## Phase 7: Testing Implementation ✅ (Partial)
- [x] Write integration tests for search functionality
- [x] Create integration tests with test data store
- [ ] Add Slack message formatting tests
- [ ] Implement error handling scenario tests
- [ ] Add rate limiting tests
- [ ] Create mock tests for Vertex AI Search API

## Phase 8: Deployment & Production Setup
- [ ] Create production-ready `Dockerfile`
- [ ] Configure gunicorn for production serving
- [ ] Add Cloud Run deployment script
- [x] Implement proper logging for queries and response times
- [ ] Add error rate tracking
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting configuration

## Phase 9: Documentation & Final Setup
- [ ] Create comprehensive `README.md` with setup instructions
- [ ] Document deployment process and troubleshooting
- [ ] Add example usage and configuration guide
- [ ] Include monitoring and maintenance instructions

## Configuration Requirements Checklist ✅
- [x] PROJECT_ID configuration
- [x] LOCATION configuration (default: global)
- [x] DATA_STORE_ID configuration
- [x] APP_ID configuration
- [x] SLACK_BOT_TOKEN configuration
- [x] SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET configuration
- [x] SLACK_APP_TOKEN configuration
- [x] USE_GROUNDED_GENERATION flag
- [x] MAX_RESULTS configuration
- [x] RESPONSE_TIMEOUT configuration

## Testing Scenarios to Validate ✅ (Partial)
- [x] Bot responds to @mentions correctly
- [x] Bot responds to slash commands correctly
- [x] Bot handles DMs appropriately
- [x] Error handling when Vertex AI is unavailable
- [x] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [x] Responses include proper source attribution
- [x] Loading messages appear for slow queries
- [ ] **Follow-up questions work with context**
- [ ] **Confidence thresholds filter results appropriately (needs scoring fix)**

## Current Status Summary
**✅ COMPLETED:** Full-featured Slack RAG bot with comprehensive functionality
**✅ WORKING:** True RAG generation with Gemini integration
**✅ FIXED:** Confidence scoring now uses actual relevance scores
**✅ OPTIMIZED:** All 5 chunks (20k+ characters) now passed to Gemini for better answers
**✅ UPGRADED:** Using Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite for better performance and lower cost

## Deployment Validation
- [ ] Docker image builds successfully
- [ ] Cloud Run deployment works
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Service account has correct permissions
- [ ] Bot is responsive and handles queries within 5 seconds
- [ ] Monitoring and logging are working

## Success Metrics to Track
- [ ] Response time < 5 seconds
- [ ] Relevant results for 90%+ of queries
- [ ] Can handle 100+ queries per day
- [ ] Clear source attribution for all answers
- [ ] Graceful error handling for edge cases
